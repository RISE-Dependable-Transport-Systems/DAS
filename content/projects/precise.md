PRECISE aims to strengthen the security and resilience of software-intensive systems and digital infrastructure and thereby support Swedish industry's ability to create and use digital infrastructure. The project achieves this by developing an AI-supported framework for chaos testing of cybersecurity aspects of software-intensive systems. The framework will automatically generate and test new attack strategies and thereby identify potential vulnerabilities. The framework is also published as open source, which encourages further development of it and enables non-project partners to benefit from it.
