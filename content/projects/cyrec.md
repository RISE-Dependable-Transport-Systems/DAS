The aim of this project is to enable secure deployment of energy communities. The project addresses challenges when combining operational technologies (OT) with information technologies (IT) involving cloud- and IoT-based solutions.

The project develops new security methods for cloud-based energy systems and new collaboration models that take into account the stakeholders' contribution to cybersecurity, as well as the market conditions in the context of energy communities. The project focuses on methods for threat analysis and risk assessment when both functional safety and cybersecurity must be considered.

Key questions addressed include: challenges and enablers for new technologies in energy communities, modelling efficient collaborations for cybersecurity in multi-party environments, integrating new digital platforms with critical infrastructure, adapting threat- and risk assessment methods, and evaluating cybersecurity resistance against cyber-attacks in energy communities.
