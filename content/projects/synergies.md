Synergies aims to create a European platform and marketplace for traffic scenarios that can be used to facilitate development, testing and validation of automated vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems. As an extension of the HEADSTART and SUNRISE projects, which created a framework for safety assurance, Synergies will create a platform for interoperability between existing scenario databases, as well as methods and tools for scenario generation and scenario database management. RISE participates as a Swedish project partner creating scenarios, both from recorded data and synthetically generated, for Nordic conditions.
