MAGIC aims to increase confidence in, and streamline handling of, forensic data from vehicles to support the investigations around liability issues in incidents. To this end the project aims to develop automotive digital forensics (ADF) solutions that guarantee forensic soundness, enhance the trustworthiness of incident investigations, and identify cybersecurity-related vulnerabilities. The project implements real-time ADF mechanisms to enhance the adaptability of incident detection and protection against cyberattack threats, develops adaptive cyber-resilience and assures forensic soundness, and achieves compliance with, and potentially proposes enhancements to, UNECE R155 & R156 and ISO/SAE 21434.
