The introduction of autonomous and connected vehicles has brought new cybersecurity challenges to the automotive industry and put requirements on the dependability of vehicles in the presence of cyber-attacks. CyReV focused on cybersecurity for automotive in-vehicle systems in a changing environment.

The project developed a reference architecture for resilient vehicles, including Architecture Design Principles. It investigated novel techniques for online attack analysis and incorporated Machine Learning techniques for Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to describe normal and abnormal behaviour of traffic systems. The project also studied Defence in Depth strategies, post-attack forensics, and interplay analyses between safety and security requirements.

Expected results include in-vehicle intrusion detection system techniques suitable for the resilient architecture, a framework for developing Hybrid Intrusion Detection Systems, data-driven modelling techniques for describing normal and abnormal behaviours, data collection techniques for post-attack investigations, and verification and validation strategies for evaluating resilient vehicles.
