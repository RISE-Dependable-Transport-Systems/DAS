HIVEMIND introduces an adaptive LLM-based framework enabling collaboration between human actors and AI agents tailored to mirror and provide specialized support for the various roles involved in conventional software development teams. RISE contributes to the development of three AI agents intended to support design-by-contract programming during the software lifecycle: CodeGenAgent, QualityAgent and TestGenAgent. RISE also contributes to the development of two AI agents intended to accelerate maintenance and deployment of software systems: MaintainAgent and DeploymentAgent.
