FAMER will establish concepts, models and techniques to effectively set requirements for safe perception systems. FAMER approaches the challenges in the system-of-system context, where several organizations and disciplines (multiple parties) must be brought together and where the complexity of the system requires an iterative collaborative approach. The research aims to develop a domain description and system reference architecture, an information model for managing knowledge and requirement creation, and demonstration of agile multi-party collaboration.
