VALU3S designed a multi-domain framework to create a clear structure around components and elements needed to conduct the V&V process. This included designing, implementing and evaluating methods and tools in order to reduce the time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cybersecurity and privacy requirements. The main benefit of the multi-domain framework developed by the project is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems.
