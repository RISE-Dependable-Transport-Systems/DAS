WayWiseR is a ROS2-based rapid prototyping platform designed for Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) validation research. Extending the low-level functionalities provided by the WayWise library with standardized ROS2 interfaces, WayWiseR enables systematic scenario-based validation across both simulated and physical environments.
